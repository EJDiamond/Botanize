# Botanize

For my project five milestone, I have created the social platform Botanize, the site offers a space where plant owners can come to share images and problems they are facing with their plants, so other users can answer and help them with tips and solutions. Alongside this, users can upload images and content about their favourite plants for others to view.

# User Experience(UX)

## Site Purpose

Botanize is a platform for plant lovers alike. The purpose of the app is for plant enthusiasts to come together and share their love and knowlegde of house plants. By allowing users to share content of their plants with info and questions, other users are then given the opportunity to answers and provide information. The main purpose of the site is to information on how people can better care for their plants.

## Site goals

Botanize aims to bring plant owners together, whilst building an archive of plant problems and solutions that other users can search through and hopefully use to remedy problems they have with their own plants. The site will also provide users with the option to post pictures of their beloved plants to share with the community.

## Audience

The target audience for Botanize are:

- Lovers of houseplants.
- People looking for advice and tips in how to  care for their plants.
- People interested in giving advice and sharing their knowledge of plants.
- People looking to show others their own plants.

## Communication

Botanize is intended to resemble existing social platforms so users feel familiar and can navigate the site with ease. The navigation bar is available throughout the site so the user can quickly move across desired pages.

## Current User Goals

Current users will be able to find solutions to their plant problems by posting and returning to the site to find answers other users have given. The will be able to search for similar issues other users have experienced to see if they can find answers there.

## New User Goals

To interest new users into using the site for any plant issues or adive they may have.

## Future Goals

- To implement a profiles page where user profiles can be scrolled through and followed by other users.
- To provide the ability for users to send direct messages to one another.

## Design

### Typography

I chose the two fonts Merriweather Sans and Annie use your telescope:

- [Annie use your telescope](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Annie+Use+Your+Telescope?query=Annie) was used for the navbar brand all the headings on the page.

- [Merriweather Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather+Sans?query=merri) was used across the body of the site.
